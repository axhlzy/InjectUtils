This documentation explains how to build Keystone on Windows.
For *nix OS, see [COMPILE-NIX.md](COMPILE-NIX.md)


1. Dependency

  CMake is required as dependency.
  Download & install cmake from http://www.cmake.org

  Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or older is required for compiling.
  Download & install it from https://www.visualstudio.com

  Python is another dependency. Download & install it from
  https://www.python.org


2. Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt, and from the root directory
  of Keystone source, do:

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build

  To build DLL file, run:

        $ ..\nmake-dll.bat

  By default, this builds all architectures, which is: AArch64, ARM, Hexagon,
  Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86. To compile just some selected ones,
  pass a semicolon-separated list of targets to LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD,
  like follows if we only want AArch64 & X86.

        $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AArch64;X86" -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
        $ nmake

  To build LIB file, run:

        $ ..\nmake-lib.bat

  Like above, this builds all architectures. To compile just some selected ones,
  pass a semicolon-separated list of targets to LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD,
  like follows if we only want AArch64 & X86.

        $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AArch64, X86" -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
        $ nmake

  Find the generated libraries in build\llvm\lib\keystone.{dll,lib}
  
  In the case you build LIB file, a tool named "kstool.exe" is also
  compiled & available under directory "build\kstool".
  (Find source of "kstool" in directory "kstool/kstool")


3. Test Keystone with "kstool" like below.

        $ kstool.exe x32 "add eax, ebx"

  Run "kstool.exe" without any option to find out how to use this handy tool.
