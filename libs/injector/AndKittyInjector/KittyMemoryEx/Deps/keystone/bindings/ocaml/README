OCaml bindings to the Keystone library (www.keytone-engine.org)

Make sure Keystone is built and installed.

Requires OCaml (>= 4.01.0) and Opam (optionally Oasis)

If Keystone was not installed in the default location then the
keystone_header_loc variable in config.ml needs to be set to the
correct location. The default location is
"/usr/local/include/keystone/keystone.h"


To Build:

1. Install opam. Make sure to run eval `opam config env` to make sure
   environment variables are set properly. 

2. Install necessary packages:

   opam install ctypes ctypes-foreign uchar result ocamlfind

4. Run make

5. Test the bindings by running ./test-bindings.native

To rebuild the build files (make, configure etc) run oasis setup

To install the bindings run make install

To build documentation run make doc
